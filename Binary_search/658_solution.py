#binery_search
#Explanation:
We need to return k elements that are closest to x. The input array is sorted in ascending order. So, we will try to find the starting point of these k elements i.e. the first element in this list of k elements which will make it easier to return the k elements. Let's call this first element of the output list low.
We will initially create a boundary of size k . Why size k? Because the starting point of the boundary will give us the k elements we need.
So initially our low bound will be 0. The upper bound will be length of array - k. Why?
Suppose our array is 1 2 3 4 5 and k=2 . Then in our final output start of the window must lie between 0 and 4 . If it lies at 5, we cannot pick k elements. So, it makes sense for our upper bound to be len(arr) - k.
Now, we want to do a binary search in order to optimise or find the correct start boundary.

The following are the cases :
x<=arr[mid].
x>=arr[mid+k]
arr[mid] < x < arr[mid+k]
I will be explaining alll these cases.
Consider what are the boundaries for our element x.
left.....mid....mid+k...........right
x<=arr[mid].
There are k+1 elements between mid and mid+k,inclusive. if x<=arr[mid], then mid+k element won't be part of our output since the array is sorted and x will be further away from mid+k element. So, in order to change the start of the boundary, our boundary can't start from mid+1 anymore (because we won't be able to include k elements.) Thus, we realise that the boundary for k elements needs to either start at mid or before it. Thus, high moves to mid(not mid-1) because mid is a valid value for the k element starting window.
2.x>=arr[mid+k]
Quite similar to the case above,if x is not less than or equal to mid, that is x is greater than mid, then the boundary for start of our answer lies after mid(excluding mid), thus low moves to mid+1.
arr[mid] < x < arr[mid+k]
If both of the earlier condtions are not satisified, then we consider the distance of x from both the mid and mid+k . If x is closer to mid,similar to the 1st case, move it away from mid+k and move high to mid. else move low to mid+1.
